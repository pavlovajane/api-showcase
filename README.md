# API showcase
A showcase API excerpt to demonstrate my everyday job tasks without violating NDA

I plan to put here the following "moving" parts:

* Database in a container on EC2
* API call for report creation
* API call for status of report check and link to s3 when ready
* S3 where the repot will be uploaded
* SQS for call #1 (aka report creation) 
* Service-consumer from SQS
* Unit tests
* Integration testa
** Test container
** Test local stack
